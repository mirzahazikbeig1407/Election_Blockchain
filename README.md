Ensuring the integrity and security of voting processes is paramount in any democratic system. Traditional voting methods are often prone to various challenges, including fraud, manipulation, and inefficiency. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized blockchainbased voting system tailored for college elections. Our system leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent, secure, and tamper-resistant platform for conducting elections.
The proposed system utilizes a decentralized network of nodes to record and validate votes,
ensuring that no single entity can manipulate the results. Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of the election process. Through theuse of smart contracts, the system can automate various aspects of the voting process, suchas candidate registration, voter authentication, and result tabulation, reducing the potentialfor human error and manipulation.
Moreover, our system prioritizes voter privacy and anonymity, ensuring that individualvoting choices are kept confidential. By integrating cryptographic techniques, such as zeroknowledge proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption, we can further enhance the securityand privacy of the voting process. Overall, our decentralized blockchain-based voting system aims to revolutionize college elections by providing a secure, transparent, and efficientplatform for conducting democratic processes.
